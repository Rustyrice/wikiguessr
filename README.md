## Wikiguessr

In this hackathon, we were given 24 hours to come up with an idea and try our best to develop it. 
After 2 hours of brainstorming, In this hackathon, our team created Wikiguessrâ€”a captivating game that challenges players to guess the title of a randomly 
selected Wikipedia article based on a given sentence extracted from that article. 
Five categories are available: countries, celebrities, movies, books, and sports.

Once a category is chosen, the game begins, providing players with five lives. Incorrect guesses result in the loss of a life, but the game provides 
additional sentences as hints. Players earn points for correctly guessing the article title, with the number of points determined by the number of guesses it took. 
For example, guessing correctly on the first try rewards 10 points, while guessing correctly on the fourth try grants 2 points.

Despite the time constraints, our team completed the project with just 10 minutes remaining and presented it to the hackathon judges. 
Overall, they were impressed with our work given how little time we had to code it.
